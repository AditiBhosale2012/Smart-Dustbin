# Smart-Dustbin
Smart dustbin based on IOT technology , Our system includes bins that have sensors which detect the garbage level in Real Time. Once the garbage will reach to its maximum limit (For our system we have taken the threshold as 90%) the bins will send alert messages along with location to the garbage collection team. The team will then reply with the time required to come and clean the bin, which will be displayed on the LCD display fitted on the bin. Once the bins will be cleaned the LCD will display “bins are cleaned”. And if the bins are not cleaned before the timer exceeds a compliant would be send to the higher authority.
